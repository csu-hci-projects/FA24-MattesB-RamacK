To run this project please use Unreal Engine version 5.4.4

This project is an FPS game with 2 levels. The first level is designed as a maze and the second level is designed as a house. Both levels
have a set number of targets that need to be destroyed in order to progress. There are hazards to avoid as you need to keep up your 
health to continue playing the level.

For this project, we split up the work between level design and UI design. Brandon handled level design and Kyle took care of UI design.
This meant that Brandon created the levels themselves, the targets, and the hazards and Kyle created the UI including ammo count,
health bars, and menus. The interactions between the two phases were done in tandem between both members. Both members collaborated
to create the blueprints for health loss/gain, target damage, and targets destroyed. The work was split in this way so that GitHub
pull requests did not overlap and we had limited merge conflicts. The only merge conflict we had was when we were both working on
UI-adjacent tasks at the end to get level transitions/ finishing touches put onto the levels.

For this project, we did not use many resources outside of class material. Some YouTube tutorials were used to assist with a few UI concepts
but for the most part we just used the class lab videos and the textbook.

As we are both online students working from different time zones, we weren't able to meet very often during this project. We met online once
the weekend before the project was due (Sunday October 20th) to go over expectations and work assignments and this meeting is when we split
up the tasks between level and UI design.
