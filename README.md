## CS310H_HW1_BM_KR (HW1):
This project is an FPS game with 2 levels. The first level is designed as a maze and the second level is designed as a house. Both levels
have a set number of targets that need to be destroyed in order to progress. There are hazards to avoid as you need to keep up your 
health to continue playing the level.

For this project, we split up the work between level design and UI design. Brandon handled level design and Kyle took care of UI design.
This meant that Brandon created the levels themselves, the targets, and the hazards and Kyle created the UI including ammo count,
health bars, and menus. The interactions between the two phases were done in tandem between both members. Both members collaborated
to create the blueprints for health loss/gain, target damage, and targets destroyed. The work was split in this way so that GitHub
pull requests did not overlap and we had limited merge conflicts. The only merge conflict we had was when we were both working on
UI-adjacent tasks at the end to get level transitions/ finishing touches put onto the levels.

For this project, we did not use many resources outside of class material. Some YouTube tutorials were used to assist with a few UI concepts
but for the most part we just used the class lab videos and the textbook.

As we are both online students working from different time zones, we weren't able to meet very often during this project. We met online once
the weekend before the project was due (Sunday October 20th) to go over expectations and work assignments and this meeting is when we split
up the tasks between level and UI design.

## CS310H_HW2_BM_KR (HW2):
This project is a VR game which tasks the player to destroy a designated number of targets. There are a number of grabbable objects throughout
the main level and a total of 6 targets. 5 of these targets are outside a building which must be destroyed before entering the building.
The final target is inside this building and, once destroyed, the level will be completed.

The work for this project was divided similarly to HW1. For HW2, Brandon made the level design, stationary UI messages, and level completion/change.
Kyle created the grabbable objects, targets, and nav barrier lock/unlock. We felt this was a fair way to evenly divide the work between group members.
For this project, our schedules were quite different to each other and as such we did not run into any merge conflicts as we were working on
different tasks at different times.

Similarly to HW1, resources provided in class through the lab videos, textbook, and teams messages were the only resources used to complete
this assignment.

As mentioned, our schedules did not align at all for this project (due to work/other responsibilities) and as such we were unable to have a
true meeting. Because of this we used teams to communicate on a daily basis on progress and any roadblocks we came across while working. This allowed
us to divide work and get everything needed done while working around opposing schedules. The use of GitHub and proper GitHub etiquette with pull
requests kept us both responsible and aware of what each was doing and when.
